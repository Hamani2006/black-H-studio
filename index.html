  <section><h1>black h studio</h1>
    <h3>hi I am Abdulrahman and this is the first website I made it's with js-HTML-CSS and it's 
      not easy it took 
      3 weeks and I got a lot of bugs 
      so I was sad and I stayed up early to finish things 
      and I used my laptop to make it and it was easy if you focus sometimes when
       I don't have school I work on my site to finish it and sometimes when I am stuck at somewhere 
       I can't figure out I copy-paste my files on a drive and show my computer teacher what's wrong and he helps out and 
       I made my site better and better each time and I will still work on it till it's the best site ever and I will never 
       give up no matter what and I never back up on my word trust me </h3>
